            <h2>I'm Sorry</h2>
            <p>I know I haven't always been the person you deserve. There have been moments when I let you down, when I wasn't there when you needed me, when I said things I shouldn't have said. I'm sorry for every tear I've caused, every disappointment I've brought, every time I took you for granted.</p>
            <p>You've been my rock, my safe place, my everything, and I haven't always shown you the love and appreciation you so richly deserve. I'm sorry for the times I was selfish, for the moments I didn't listen, for the days I wasn't present.</p>
            <p>But I promise you this: I am learning, I am growing, I am becoming the person you deserve. Every day, I strive to be better, to love you more deeply, to cherish you more fully. You inspire me to be my best self, and I will never stop trying to be worthy of your love.</p>

            <h2>Happy Birthday, My Love</h2>
            <p>Today is your day, and I want you to know how incredibly special you are. You bring light to my darkest days, joy to my saddest moments, and love to my loneliest nights. You are the reason I believe in magic, the reason I smile every morning, the reason my heart beats with purpose.</p>
            <p>On your birthday, I want to celebrate not just the day you were born, but every day since then that you've been in this world. Every day you've been you‚Äîkind, beautiful, strong, compassionate, funny, and absolutely perfect in every way.</p>
            <p>I hope this year brings you everything you've ever dreamed of, everything you deserve, and more happiness than you can imagine. You deserve the world, and I promise to spend every day trying to give it to you.</p>
            <p>Happy Birthday, my love. Here's to another year of us, of our love story, of building a life together that's as beautiful as you are. üíï</p>
